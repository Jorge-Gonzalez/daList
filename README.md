## Todo List PWA using todo txt format

This is a todo list progressive web app that intend to be simple and modern.
I am using Preact, Redux Bundler, Stylable.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# test the production build locally
yarn start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
